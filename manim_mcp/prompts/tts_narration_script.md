Create an educational narration script (6-10 sentences) for a math animation video about:

{prompt}

The narration should:
1. Start with an introduction to the topic
2. Describe each visual step that should appear (e.g., "First, let's draw a coordinate plane")
3. Explain the mathematical concepts as they would appear visually
4. End with a summary or key takeaway

Rules:
- Write as if narrating a 3Blue1Brown-style video
- Each sentence describes ONE visual step or concept
- Be specific about what should appear (axes, vectors, equations, etc.)
- Keep sentences under 25 words each
- Use educational, engaging language

Return ONLY the narration text, one sentence per line. Each sentence will correspond to a scene in the animation.
